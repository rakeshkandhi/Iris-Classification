    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Iris Classification Project! This project is designed to
        demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques for
        classifying iris flowers into different species based on their features.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust
        classification model that accurately identifies the species of iris
        flowers. The model is trained on a dataset containing various iris
        samples with different measurements.
    </p>

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset used for training and testing the classification model is
        the famous Iris dataset. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal
        width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris
        flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

    <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
    <p>
        The Iris Classification Project leverages popular machine learning
        libraries such as scikit-learn for model development and Python
        programming language for implementation. The classification model is
        typically built using algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or
        Decision Trees.
